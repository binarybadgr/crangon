# Crangon

## Description

Experimental counter and analyzer aquaculture animals with state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning methodology for minimizing error from human and maximizing the accuracy of counting

## Preresquisite

- OpenCV4
- JSON

### Debian

```bash
sudo apt install libopencv-dev libjson-dev
```

### FreeBSD

```
sudo pkg install opencv jsoncpp
```

## Features

Standard features that machine can do

### Counter

Design to reduce human error when counting by hand and exceed human speed with unbeatable process time

This machine has already been evaluated by real example of 250 prawns, accuracy is approximately 95 percent

Expecting accuracy to be more than 90 percent or above __depends on speed of water flow__ (which can be adjust but requires some calculation)

The program design to run as background process, it won't display anything unless open with debug flag
